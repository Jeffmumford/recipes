<h3>Homemade Pizza</h3>
<p>Homemade frozen pizzas only take a small amount of time to put together for large quantities of pizza on hand in the freezer at all times. Itâ€™s the perfect freezer meal that the whole family will love.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp. instant dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tbsp. brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp. salt</li>
    <li>2 cups warm water</li>
    <li>3 tbsp. olive oil</li>
    <li>5 cups flour</li>
    <li>pizza sauce</li>
    <li>cheese</li>
    <li>toppings</li>
</ul>


<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
   <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine yeast, brown sugar, salt, water, and flour.</li>
   <li>Knead on low until dough starts to come together. Continue kneading until the dough forms a nice, soft dough ball and the sides of the bowl are clean.</li>
   <li>Let rise in a lightly greased bowl, covered, for 1 to 2 hours, until doubled.</li>
   <li>Divide the dough into three equal pieces and roll out into pizza crusts.</li>
   <li>Place crust on a tray for freezing.</li>
   <li>Top with desired sauce, cheese, and other toppings.</li>
   <li>Freeze</li>
   <li>Once solid, wrap with plastic wrap and store in the freezer. Pizzas stay good for 1 to 3 months.</li>
    <li>To bake, preheat a pizza stone in the oven at 500 degrees. Bake until cheese is browning and bubbly, about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
</ol>
